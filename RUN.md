# How to Run - PowerShell Commands

## ✅ Correct PowerShell Syntax

### Start the Server:
```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

Or if you need to change directory first:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Santosh\OneDrive\Desktop\DESIGN LAB PROJECTS\smart bank app"
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Note:
- PowerShell uses `;` (semicolon) to separate commands, NOT `&&`
- Or just run commands on separate lines
- The server is already running in the background from my previous command
